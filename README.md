3. The app sends it to an **AI enhancement model** (cloud or local).  
4. The enhanced image is displayed with before/after comparison.  
5. Users can **save, share, or store** the enhanced image in Firebase Cloud Storage.

<img src="landing.png" width="200" style="display:block; margin-bottom:10px;" />
<img src="home.png" width="200" style="display:block; margin-bottom:10px;" />
